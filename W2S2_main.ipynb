            "   - Handle missing values (if any) based on the dataset’s complete nature, if necessary.\n",
            "   - Encode categorical variables using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.\n",
            "   - Normalize or standardize numerical variables if required.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:\n",
            "   - Visualize the distribution of numerical features and their relationship with the target variable.\n",
            "   - Check for correlations between variables, especially numerical ones, using correlation matrices.\n",
            "   - Understand the distribution of laptop prices and identify any outliers.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Model Selection**:\n",
            "   - For predicting laptop prices, a linear regression model could be a good starting point given its simplicity and interpretability.\n",
            "   - More complex models like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting might be employed for better accuracy if linear regression doesn’t yield satisfactory results.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Model Training and Evaluation**:\n",
            "   - Split the data into training and testing sets (commonly a 70-30 or 80-20 split).\n",
            "   - Train the model on the training set and evaluate its performance on the testing set using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared, etc.\n",
            "   - Perform feature importance analysis to see which features contribute the most to price predictions.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Model Refinement**:\n",
            "   - Tune hyperparameters to optimize the model’s performance.\n",
            "   - Consider feature selection techniques to refine chosen features, improving the model's robustness.\n",
            "\n",
            "6. **Prediction and Interpretation**:\n",
            "   - Use the final model to make price predictions on unseen data.\n",
            "   - Interpret the results, providing insights on how different features influence laptop prices.\n",
